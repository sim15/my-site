          Hi! I&apos;m Simon, a high school student curious about computer science and mathematics. 
          I love making stuff and exploring new ideas; I&apos;m particularly excited by projects that combine ideas to tackle real problems in a novel way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests lie primarily in cryptography and theoretical computer science. 
          Check out my projects for a more detailed description.
